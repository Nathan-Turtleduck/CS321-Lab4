# CS321-Lab4

This project had us implement a BTree's logic for use in reading and loading in DNA sequences.
There are several bugs left in the final version. We have deduced that the issue may reside in the BTree Search method or the print tree method.
For best use of this BTree be sure to use the degree of 0. This has proved to generate the best tree that seems to work a majority of the time.
