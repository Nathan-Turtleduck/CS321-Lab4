In this document we discuss our grievances with this project:

After hours of debugging we finally got our BTree class to work and run.
We discovered that there were other issues once we finally got a result. We boiled our issues
down to the TreeTraversal method and the TreeSearch method. We think the last of our problems reside in these
methods. We don't have the resources to solve these problems but have been working on them for hours on end.
We attended a learning help session but didn't find any fixes to our problems and ended up solving them on our own.

We are quite clueless on figuring out how to implement Cache into our project. We are hoping that by typing
up this readme we can at least get a couple points for it being here. Even though we didn't implement Cache,
it's a pretty safe assumption to say that our program would run faster if we used it.

If we were to do this project again, we would want more guidance when it comes to the BTree class and better
pseudocode to follow. The pseudocode kind of guided us in the right direction but fell flat because of how we
implemented it. We didn't have any pseudocode on the TreeTraversal method so I think that caused problems as well.

Regardless, we all tried our best and put a lot of time into this project.
